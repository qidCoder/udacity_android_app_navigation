## In This Lesson

Organizing your application into concise and distinct features that flow in a highly-usable experience is a critical step in any successful application. While going through the lesson, think about the following:

How many distinct features do the applications you use have?
How are they arranged?
What might the navigation graph look like for these applications?
How do you, the user, navigate to and from each feature?
What navigation methods are present?
Do they work well with the hardware navigation?
Have you ever felt abandoned or unable to get where you want to go?
Are other applications a part of the experience? Browser, Camera, etc.
